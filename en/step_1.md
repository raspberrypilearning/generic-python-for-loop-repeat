To run the code in a `for` loop a certain number of times, you can use the `range()` function.

```python
for item in range(10):
  print('Doing something')
```

**Tip:** Because this code isn't using the value of `item`, you don't need to worry about the fact `range(10)` gives the numbers 0 to 9, instead of 1 to 10 â€” there are still ten numbers, so the code will run ten times.
